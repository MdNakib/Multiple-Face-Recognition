# About
For face detection Haar model is used. It can detect faces in an image, hence, ROI(Region of Interest) can be extracted using this model.
Then for face recognition, first data needs to be trained. LBPH(Local Binary Pattern Histogram) model has been used for data training.
# How to use
This project uses `opencv-python` and `numpy` module. To use them, write following commands:

`pip install opencv-python numpy`
